12 Blog Posts: Economics, AI, and Human Welfare
1. Beyond Supply and Demand: Why Economics Should Focus on Human
Welfare
Economics isn't just about charts and curves—it's about people. When I discovered economics in
college, what captivated me wasn't the traditional focus on supply and demand. Instead, I was drawn
to something deeper: frameworks for making decisions that increase everyone's welfare, create
efficient systems without noise, and prevent extraction between people.
The beauty of economics lies in its ability to track concepts like utility—essentially, how happy
something makes you. We can measure the overall welfare of groups, track whether producers,
consumers, and workers are all benefiting, and even quantify diminishing returns (like how much
happier that third hamburger really makes you).
This isn't abstract theory. These frameworks help us make real decisions with big impacts. As we face
unprecedented disruption from AI, we need economics that serves humanity, not just markets. It's time
to use these tools to build systems that maximize welfare for everyone, not just shareholders.
2. The Two-Headed Crisis: Income and Meaning in the Age of AI
We're facing a dual crisis that threatens the foundation of how we've organized society. First, there's
the obvious one: income disruption. As AI displaces thousands—soon to be millions—of workers, we
need immediate solutions. Whether through direct income support, housing programs, or food
assistance, we must act now.
But there's a second, equally urgent crisis: the disruption of meaningful contribution. Once our basic
needs are met, humans need purpose. We've historically tied our identities to our jobs. "I'm an
accountant," we say, not "I do accounting."
What happens when AI makes your 30-year career obsolete? The financial challenge is clear, but the
existential one runs deeper. How do we help people navigate redefining who they are when their
professional identity evaporates? How do we recognize that being a good listener, a community
builder, or a creative soul has value even if it doesn't produce traditional economic output?
This isn't just about retraining or upskilling. It's about fundamentally rethinking what contribution
means in a world where human labor becomes optional rather than essential.
3. The 400-Yard Dash Myth: Why "Equal Opportunity" Is a Lie
Imagine a 400-yard dash where one runner starts at the 50-yard line, another at 100, another at 150,
and someone else just two feet from the finish. Would you call that equal opportunity? Yet that's
exactly the race we're all running.
We've been pretending for decades that everyone has the same shot at success. Born in the right
place, at the right time, to the right family? You're starting near the finish line. Born elsewhere? Good
luck catching up, no matter how fast you run.
This isn't about making excuses or playing victim. It's about having honest conversations about the
advantages we're born with—or without. When we acknowledge that the race was never fair, we can
start building systems that actually work for everyone, not just those who started on third base thinking
they hit a triple.
The interesting thing about economic principles is their flexibility. Want to justify trickle-down
economics? You can find a model for that. Want to prove it doesn't work? There's a model for that too.
But the evidence is clear: maximizing shareholder value hasn't lifted all boats. It's concentrated wealth
at the top while leaving millions behind.
4. From Competition to Collaboration: Building High-Trust Communities
What if we stopped asking "What can I get from this exchange?" and started asking "What can I
contribute?" It sounds idealistic, but we have proof it works. Look at Wikipedia—it beat out well-funded
competitors like Encarta not through financial incentives but through people contributing for the
satisfaction of building something meaningful together.
We're creating high-trust environments where members share values and support each other. Imagine
an Airbnb-style system within a trusted community—you're away for three months, someone in the
collective needs housing, and the match happens based on shared values and mutual trust, not just
financial transactions.
This isn't about abandoning all systems of exchange. We still need ways to measure and track
contribution. But what if capital became less of a driving force and more of a tool? What if the meaning
behind the exchange—human dignity, welfare, and contribution—became the focus?
The age of winner-take-all competition isn't serving most of us. For those aligned with different values,
we're creating another option. Not fighting the system, but peacefully building alternatives within it.
5. The Grief Journey of AI Disruption
We're all going through a grief journey with AI, and that's okay. Like any major loss, we experience
denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and eventually, acceptance. Many of us are still in that denial
phase—and there's no pressure to rush through it.
As someone who likes to plan, I wanted to see the end of this story so I could prepare for it. I realized
there could be a gap if no one stepped up to address this in a human-centric way. Governments won't
do it—or at least not well. The programs we have provide the bare minimum. Our goal is to raise that
minimum so the standard of life actually improves for everyone.
This isn't about forcing everyone to learn AI. That's the panic response talking. We don't need
everyone to become AI experts—that's kind of the point. AI means we need fewer humans for many
tasks. What we need are good listeners, community builders, and people who can help others navigate
this transition.
Some will be interested in AI, and that's great. Others won't, and that's equally valuable. The question
isn't "How do I avoid being replaced?" It's "How do we build systems that value human contribution
beyond economic productivity?"
6. Redefining Contribution: When Your Job Isn't Your Identity
"What do you do?" It's often the first question we ask. But what if your answer could be "I listen to
people and help them process change" instead of "I'm an accountant"? What if we valued human
connection as much as spreadsheet skills?
We're experimenting with systems that reward contributions beyond traditional financial outcomes.
You can earn recognition for learning about the collective, sharing knowledge with friends, facilitating
groups, or simply being present for others. This isn't charity—it's recognizing that human value
extends far beyond economic productivity.
Daniel Pink's book "Drive" reveals something crucial: people actually do better work when they're not
directly thinking about monetary rewards. When we remove the constant pressure of "What am I
getting out of this?" we free people to contribute their best selves.
Our rough draft includes credit systems for direct exchange and XP systems for community
contribution. It's imperfect, but it's a start. Over the next decade, we'll refine these models based on
what actually increases human welfare, not just what maximizes profit.
7. The Wikipedia Model: Proof That Purpose Beats Profit
When Wikipedia launched, Encarta had everything: Microsoft's backing, capital, top talent, and all the
"economic factors" that should guarantee success. Yet Wikipedia won. Why? Because people
contributed not for money but for meaning.
This tells us something profound: systems focused on collective benefit can outperform those driven
by individual profit. When we stop constantly asking "What's in it for me?" and start asking "How can
this help everyone?" we unlock potential that purely financial incentives can't touch.
There's a satisfaction in giving without knowing exactly what you'll get back—"don't let your left hand
know what your right hand's doing." The leaders we admire most aren't those who extracted the most
value but those who sacrificed for movements they believed in.
This isn't about abandoning all financial systems. We need measurement and exchange mechanisms.
But what if financial capital became just one tool among many, rather than the primary driving force it's
been for so many years?
8. Building the Cooperative Future: More Than a Business Model
We're not just building a business—we're building a movement. That's why we chose a cooperative
structure. We need to make money to fund projects long-term, and we've set aside funds specifically
to care for people over time. But profit isn't the point; it's the tool.
Our vision includes housing projects, food and clothing provisions, and comprehensive support
systems. But equally important are the resources, collaboration, and support groups to help people
navigate redefining contribution in a world where humans don't produce most goods and services.
When human contribution becomes more human-centric—focused on art, creativity, and connection—
we need systems that recognize and reward these contributions. It's inevitable, so why not plan for it
instead of being blindsided?
We believe the pie is big enough for everyone. This isn't win-lose. Some will contribute more because
they can; others less. That's okay. We need to accept reality instead of pretending everyone has equal
opportunity or that trickle-down economics will suddenly start working after decades of failure.
9. The ADHD Advantage: Why Neurodivergent Minds Will Thrive
For those of us who are neurodivergent, this AI era is an absolute miracle. We can take our
disorganized thoughts and have them organized reliably. For years, society was built for neurotypical
"gatherer's brains," while those of us with "hunter's brains" felt awkward and out of place.
School was disinteresting, traditional work structures felt constraining, and our ways of thinking were
seen as deficits rather than different strengths. But now? The same qualities that made us "bad
employees" might make us ideal navigators of this new world.
I've learned hard lessons about my own limitations. I'
