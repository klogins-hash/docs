# Untitled 10

study, attractive women are three times more likely to wear fake wedding rings. That is a great one, but you guys get the point of this like you're just filtering it through 13 different options, and you can actually, I give this. I told everybody to do this before, but if you are trying to get more views on your videos, and let's say a video flopped for you, let's say this video, this guy, had 220,000 views so far. It was posted two days ago. So it's doing good. I always have the pressure of like. It's not a million like we saw.

It's also like we can always squeeze more views out of everything. It's all testing.
